## 🧠 Overview  
**Day 09** of my #100Days100Projects challenge — exploring **Python Sets & Tuples**.  
I practiced how sets help with **unique elements, mathematical set operations**, and how tuples provide **immutable data storage**.  

To apply these, I built an **Ingredient Checker App** 🍳, which validates if a recipe can be prepared based on available kitchen items using set operations.

## 🎯 Today’s Project Spotlight: Ingredient Checker App 🥗  

A practical utility app that checks if all required ingredients for a recipe are available in the kitchen.  

🔧 Features:  
- Define a set of available ingredients  
- Compare with the recipe’s required ingredients  
- Show missing ingredients clearly  
- Quick validation for cooking decisions  

💡 Demonstrates the real-world use of **sets** in handling uniqueness and membership checking.
